Tasks list in Etherpad
======================


todo
====
* Using background image means any task that goes over multiline shows both the non completed and completed
* Clicking the checklist item still doesnt toggle state, a function exists that does it but it's not available
* Doing tab then shift tab destroys the checklist item
* Hitting enter at the end of a line with a checklist item doesnt continue the checklist
* Hitting the checklist button doesnt put the caret back in the browser
* Indent then unindent removes the checklist
* Removing the checklist of an indented object removes the indentation
* Get better image for editbar
